A minimal viable product (in the development world) is something that you can quickly develop and release to your target market in order to get feedback.  

This initial release is not a proof of concept or a prototype -- it is a finished product that has roughly 20% of all your needed functionality to solve 80% of your customers' problems.

Getting feedback early in your product's life cycle will allow you to more easily make changes to your product and have a more successful product as it matures since you had gotten direct feedback from your target market. 

Having to be able to change your product on the fly leads the way for your development to be agile.
