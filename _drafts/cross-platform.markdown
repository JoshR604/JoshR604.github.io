Have you ever heard this line before:

___

> Build once and deploy everywhere.

Doesn't that sound just great? To be able to develop one single code base and not have to worry about managing different projects, different operating systems or different languages nor all the baggage those particulars bring along with them such as: extensive version control, fine-tuned build processes, device-specific limitations, and the need for more developers on your team.

To a business, all of these seem like benefits and are very alluring to smaller companies who are trying to make their product available to as much of the market as possible with as little resources as possible. Theoretically, many thousands of dollars can be saved -- from reduced development costs to reduced maintenance costs.

BUT... (that's a big but) in my experience these benefits rarely come to fruition. In my experience, the companies who are tring to take advantage of cross-platform solutions are To a business all of those pros and cons seem like pros and cons. If we go ahead and put on our developer hats and read those 'pros' and 'cons' again: single code base, extensive version control, device-specific limitations and the need for more developers... It gets a little bit harder to decipher what a pro is and what a con is.

For instance, when it comes to maintenance, having one huge code base will be more difficult to maintain for many reasons, i.e., down the road, when your current developer leaves (probably cause she was overworked) and you need to hire a new developer it will take much longer to get her up-to-speed since the project will be much more obtuse and complex due to it having to work on multiple OS's. So, sure... having a single developer will save costs at the beginning - but when that single developer leaves you your product development is going to come to a halt.

Choose the right tool for the job, bla bla -- theres no such thing as magic. bla bla strategically plan out what your goal is bla bla.

In my experience what ends up happening is you end up with a single developer developing a huge product into a single code base that has to end up working on any device imaginable. What this does is open up the entire project to more bottle necks and risks.
