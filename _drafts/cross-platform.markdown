Have you ever heard this line before:

___

> Build once and deploy everywhere.

Doesn't that sound just great? To be able to develop one single code base and not have to worry about managing different projects, different operating systems or different languages nor all the baggage those particulars bring along with them such as: extensive version control, fine-tuned build processes, device-specific limitations, and the need for more developers on your team.

To a business, all of these seem like benefits and are very alluring to smaller companies who are trying to capture both sides of the market (iOS & Android). Theoretically, many thousands of dollars can be saved -- from reduced development costs to reduced maintenance costs.



<!-- You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
