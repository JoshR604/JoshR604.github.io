Yes! You are absolutely correct. This is just another tech blog... but you can expect that I will do my best to keep things interesting by adding in some of my dry humour and funner-than-most facts so that even though it is just another tech blog, it's at least not just another <i>boring</i> tech blog.

What you can also expect to find here at this particular tech blog are my thoughts and past (or current) experiences on various mobile and web technologies in regards to development. I have <a target="_blank" href="http://grammarist.com/spelling/learned-learnt/"><i>learnt?</i></a> a lot about software development over the years from blogs just like this one -- I thought perhaps now is a good chance to give back to the community a little bit by creating this blog and sharing some of my knowledge with ya'll!

Beside my petty thoughts I am hoping to eventually add some iOS and Android tutorials here. I am planning to make the tutorials useful for peoples of all skill levels from absolute beginner to peppered veterans.

The roadmap I have for this blog might change over time as this is not a set-in-stone mission statement... but I will do my best to make sure that this blog does not become just another <i>boring</i> tech blog.
